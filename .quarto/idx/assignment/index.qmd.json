That means you can skip some weeks. It is up to you which weeks you decide to skip. The summary must be no longer than three-quarters of a page (single-spaced, 12-point font). These summaries must be submitted via Canvas by **10:50 am** on Thursdays. No credit will be given for submissions after class has started.\n\nYou can find a brief guide on how to write a summary [here](../resource/summaries.html).\n\n\n## Three Papers \n\nFor this course, you will write three papers in addition to smaller assignments throughout the semester to help you develop your ideas and receive feedback on/for these pieces.\n\n**1. Literature Review (15% of final grade):** You will select a topic of interest to you (in Latina/o politics) and write a review of the literature in said topic. Ideally, you will pick a topic that you will explore further in your final paper (see below).\n\n**2. Campaign memo (15% of final grade):** You will write a campaign memo on the political attitudes and behaviors of Latinos/as. Your audience for this memo will be a hypothetical campaign for Senate where you are working.\n\n**3. Final paper (20% of final grade):** In your final paper, you will write the \"front end of a research paper.\" This means you will have a research question, literature review, expectations based on theory, and a research design. Ideally, the question will be the same as the one that motivated the literature review from earlier in the course (but it may also be a different one).\n\n\nWe will work on different parts of the final paper over the course of the semester.\n\n- Topic proposal with research question (due date TBD)\n- Literature review (due date TBD)\n- Research design (due date TBD)\n\n\n## Oral Presentation (15% of final grade)\n\nYou will do a conference-style presentation of your final paper.\n\nI will provide further instructions later on.\n\n\n\n"},"formats":{"html":{"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":"auto","echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[]},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","toc":true,"highlight-style":"monokai","output-file":"index.html"},"language":{},"metadata":{"lang":"en","fig-responsive":true,"quarto-version":"1.2.280","_quarto-vars":{"author":"Enrique Quezada-Llanes","instructor":{"name":"Enrique Quezada-Llanes","name_no_title":"Enrique Quezada-Llanes","email":"enrique.quezada@rice.edu","url":"https://www.equezadallanes.com","twitter":"oequezada","github":"equezadallanes","office":"Herzstein Hall 102","contact_policy":"For questions about the course, please reach out via email.
