We will begin by discussing Latino/x identity, identifying and describing the demographics of this population, and analyzing the extent to which Latinos have politicized identities. We will then analyze historical and demographic trends, including immigration patterns and policies as well as Chicano social and labor movements. After that, we will discuss Latino political behavior, where we will cover Latino public opinion, partisan affiliations, voting patterns, and representation. We will finish the course by discussing the role of Latinos in the last two elections, reflecting on both the narratives of the Latino vote in academia and the media.\n\n## Learning Outcomes\n\n- Develop an understanding of the complexity of Latino/x identity in the United States\n- Situate Latino politics in the United States in historical and sociopolitical context\n- Think critically about the interactions between Latino political behavior and American political institutions\n- Apply the theories and concepts from research on Latino politics to current events\n\n\n## Work and Assessment\n\n### Course Expectations\n\nStudents are expected to attend class and participate during class discussions. This course has both a lecture and a discussion component. The lectures will incorporate the readings assigned for that day/week. I expected you will have completed all readings prior to class and will come prepared with comments and questions. Unless noted otherwise, all readings will be made available on Canvas.\n\n\n### Assignments and grades\n\nFinal course grades will be assigned as follows:\n\n\n\n\n\n<div class=\"centered-table\">\n\n\n\n----------------------------------\nGrade     Range   Grade    Range  \n------- --------- ------- --------\nA        93–100%  C        73–76% \n\nA−       90–92%   C−       70–72% \n\nB+       87–89%   D+       67–69% \n\nB        83–86%   D        63–66% \n\nB−       80–82%   D−       60–62% \n\nC+       77–79%   F        < 60%  \n----------------------------------\n\n\n<div>\n\n\nFinal grades will be calculated based on the following components:\n\n**Participation (20%)**: All students are expected to be active participants in class discussions. Our learning experience will be enhanced if you come prepared and ready to share your comments, insights, and/or questions from the material covered in the lectures and readings with the rest of the class.\n\n  - <ins>*Attendance policy:*</ins> Attendance is part of your participation grade, and while there is no separate grade for attendance it is a prerequisite for in-class participation. That said, to accommodate unforeseeable circumstances, you have two *unexcused* absences that will not affect your participation grade. Please let the instructor know about any excused absences you anticipate during the semester. Note that students who are absent, whether excused or not, are still expected to submit the weekly summary corresponding to that week.\n\n\n**Weekly summaries (15%)**: Each week for 9 weeks, you will summarize one of the readings (bolded below). That means you can skip some weeks. It is up to you which weeks you decide to skip. The summary must be no longer than three-quarters of a page (single-spaced, 12-point font). These summaries must be submitted via Canvas by **10:50 am** on Thursdays. No credit will be given for submissions after class has started.\n\n\n**Two Papers (30%; 15% each)**: You will be writing two short papers (4-6 pages each) throughout the course. These assignments will require you to think about how what we learn in class relates to what you can observe in your political environment (what some call \"the real world\"). The assignment will also provide you with an opportunity to practice writing in different two genres for two different audiences. You can find a short description of each paper below (detailed instructions will be provided on Canvas):\n\n  1. <ins>*Literature Review (4-6 pages):*</ins> students will select a topic of interest and discuss how the existing literature address that topic. Students will identify what kinds of data political scientists have analyzed and will identify a gap in the literature that they would be interested in addressing in their final paper. The audience for this paper is an academic audience interested in Latino politics.\n  \n  2. <ins>*Campaign memo (4-6 pages):*</ins> students will write a campaign memo for a Senate campaign on the political attitudes and behaviors of Latinos/as. Students must provide sufficient background, provide clear takeaways, and propose strategies for a political campaign to appeal to Latino voters. The audience for this paper is a political campaign staff.\n\n- Papers must be submitted via Canvas. Late submissions will be penalized: half a point (out of 10) if turned in late but on the same day and one point for each 24-hour period after the due date.\n\n\n\n**Oral Presentation (15%)**: Students will give an oral presentation based on their idea for the final paper. This will take the form of a conference presentation. Further instructions will be provided on Canvas and the instructor will model how to do such a presentation.\n\n\n**Final Paper (20%)**: In the final paper for this class, students will propose a research design to answer a question of interest. The question may be the same as the one that motivated the literature review from earlier in the course, but it may also be a different one. This paper must include an introduction, a literature review that situates the present question in the broader field, an answer to the question (the argument/theory), and a proposed design to answer the question. Students should meet with the instructor to discuss the paper and think about how one might design a study to answer the question of interest.\n\n\n\n## Course Conduct\n\nIn this class, we will discuss politics *and* the people who participate (or not) in politics, and we will do so in a respectful environment. As in bound to be the case when we talk about politics, we may discuss topics that might be controversial or of a sensitive nature for some or all in our group. Our goal in this class is to have constructive discussions about the politics of Latinos in the United States. Derogatory comments toward other students will not be tolerated.\n\n\n## Communication Policy\n\nIf you have questions about class in general or about a specific assignment, you can email me. You can expect a response within 24 hours (unless you email me on Friday). Students are also more than welcome to attend office hours, as this is time set aside specifically for you. Please note that I will not be \"pre-grading\" assignments, but I am happy to answer clarifying questions about them either via email or, preferably, during office hours.\n\n\n## Revision Policy\n\nYou will have the opportunity to revise the campaign memo. If you wish to do so, you must meet with me during office hours within one week of receiving the graded assignment. During that meeting, we will discuss the feedback and the revisions you think are needed. Please submit the revised draft as an attachment in the original Canvas assignment no later than one week after our meeting.\n\n\n## Chosen Names and Personal Pronouns\n \nEveryone has the right to be addressed by the name and pronouns that correspond to their gender identity. Rosters do not list gender or pronouns, so you may indicate the pronouns you use so that I don't make assumptions based on your name and/or appearance/self-presentation (*you are not obligated to do so*). If you use a chosen name, please let me know. Chosen names and pronouns are to be respected at all times in the classroom. Mistakes in addressing one another may happen, so I encourage an environment of openness to correction and learning. I will not however, tolerate repeated comments which disrespect or antagonize students who have indicated pronouns or a chosen name.\n\n\n## Honor Code\n\nStudents are expected to do their own work and to cite sources appropriately. Plagiarism will not be tolerated. In other words, students will be held to the standards of the Rice Honor Code to which they agreed when enrolling at this institution. You can read more about the Honor Code and the Honor System at http://honor.rice.edu/.\n\n\n## Disability Resource Center\n\nIf you have a documented disability or other condition that may affect academic performance you should: 1) make sure this documentation is on file with the Disability Resource Center (Allen Center, Room 111 / adarice@rice.edu / x5841) to determine the accommodations you need; and 2) talk with me to discuss your accommodation needs.\n\n\n## Wellbeing and Mental Health\n\nThe wellbeing and mental health of students is important; if you are having trouble completing your coursework, please reach out to the Wellbeing and Counseling Center.  Rice University provides cost-free mental health services through the Wellbeing and Counseling Center to help you manage personal challenges that threaten your personal or academic well-being. If you believe you are experiencing unusual amounts of stress, sadness, or anxiety, the Student Wellbeing Office or the Rice Counseling Center may be able to assist you. 713-348-3311 24/7.\n\n\n## Center for Academic and Professional Communication\n\nThe Center for Academic and Professional Communication offers one-on-one appointments with peer consultants who can help you improve your written, oral, and visual communication skills. You are encouraged to use this resource when working on your class assignments to make your arguments more compelling, your sentences clearer, and persistent grammatical errors nonexistent. You can schedule an appointment at https://pwc.rice.edu/center-academic-and-professional-communication.\n\n\n## Syllabus Change Policy\n\nThis syllabus is only a guide for the course and is subject to change with advanced notice.\n\n",
