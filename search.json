    "text": "Course Overview\nThis course will provide an overview of how Latinos interact with, relate to, and find representation in the American political system. We will begin by discussing Latino/x identity, identifying and describing the demographics of this population, and analyzing the extent to which Latinos have politicized identities. We will then analyze historical and demographic trends, including immigration patterns and policies as well as Chicano social and labor movements. After that, we will discuss Latino political behavior, where we will cover Latino public opinion, partisan affiliations, voting patterns, and representation. We will finish the course by discussing the role of Latinos in the last two elections, reflecting on both the narratives of the Latino vote in academia and the media."

    "text": "Work and Assessment\n\nCourse Expectations\nStudents are expected to attend class and participate during class discussions. This course has both a lecture and a discussion component. The lectures will incorporate the readings assigned for that day/week. I expected you will have completed all readings prior to class and will come prepared with comments and questions. Unless noted otherwise, all readings will be made available on Canvas.\n\n\nAssignments and grades\nFinal course grades will be assigned as follows:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGrade\nRange\nGrade\nRange\n\n\n\n\nA\n93–100%\nC\n73–76%\n\n\nA−\n90–92%\nC−\n70–72%\n\n\nB+\n87–89%\nD+\n67–69%\n\n\nB\n83–86%\nD\n63–66%\n\n\nB−\n80–82%\nD−\n60–62%\n\n\nC+\n77–79%\nF\n< 60%\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFinal grades will be calculated based on the following components:\nParticipation (20%): All students are expected to be active participants in class discussions. Our learning experience will be enhanced if you come prepared and ready to share your comments, insights, and/or questions from the material covered in the lectures and readings with the rest of the class.\n\n\nAttendance policy:\n\nAttendance is part of your participation grade, and while there is no separate grade for attendance it is a prerequisite for in-class participation. That said, to accommodate unforeseeable circumstances, you have two unexcused absences that will not affect your participation grade. Please let the instructor know about any excused absences you anticipate during the semester. Note that students who are absent, whether excused or not, are still expected to submit the weekly summary corresponding to that week.\n\nWeekly summaries (15%): Each week for 9 weeks, you will summarize one of the readings (bolded below). That means you can skip some weeks. It is up to you which weeks you decide to skip. The summary must be no longer than three-quarters of a page (single-spaced, 12-point font). These summaries must be submitted via Canvas by 10:50 am on Thursdays. No credit will be given for submissions after class has started.\nTwo Papers (30%; 15% each): You will be writing two short papers (4-6 pages each) throughout the course. These assignments will require you to think about how what we learn in class relates to what you can observe in your political environment (what some call “the real world”). The assignment will also provide you with an opportunity to practice writing in different two genres for two different audiences. You can find a short description of each paper below (detailed instructions will be provided on Canvas):\n\n\nLiterature Review (4-6 pages):\n\nstudents will select a topic of interest and discuss how the existing literature address that topic. Students will identify what kinds of data political scientists have analyzed and will identify a gap in the literature that they would be interested in addressing in their final paper. The audience for this paper is an academic audience interested in Latino politics.\n\nCampaign memo (4-6 pages):\n\nstudents will write a campaign memo on the political attitudes and behaviors of Latinos/as. Students must provide sufficient background, provide clear takeaways, and propose strategies for a political campaign to appeal to Latino voters. The audience for this paper is a political campaign staff.\n\n\nPapers must be submitted via Canvas. Late submissions will be penalized: half a point (out of 10) if turned in late but on the same day and one point for each 24-hour period after the due date.\n\nOral Presentation (15%): Students will give an oral presentation based on their idea for the final paper. This will take the form of a conference presentation. Further instructions will be provided on Canvas and the instructor will model how to do such a presentation.\nFinal Paper (20%): In the final paper for this class, students will propose a research design to answer a question of interest. The question may be the same as the one that motivated the literature review from earlier in the course, but it may also be a different one. This paper must include an introduction, a literature review that situates the present question in the broader field, an answer to the question (the argument/theory), and a proposed design to answer the question. Students should meet with the instructor to discuss the paper and think about how one might design a study to answer the question of interest."
