Literature Review (15% of final grade): You will select a topic of interest to you (in Latina/o politics) and write a review of the literature in said topic. Ideally, you will pick a topic that you will explore further in your final paper (see below).\n2. Campaign memo (15% of final grade): You will write a campaign memo on the political attitudes and behaviors of Latinos/as. Your audience for this memo will be a hypothetical campaign for Senate where you are working.\n3. Final paper (20% of final grade): In your final paper, you will write the “front end of a research paper.” This means you will have a research question, literature review, expectations based on theory, and a research design. Ideally, the question will be the same as the one that motivated the literature review from earlier in the course (but it may also be a different one).\nWe will work on different parts of the final paper over the course of the semester.\n\nTopic proposal with research question (due date TBD)\nLiterature review (due date TBD)\nResearch design (due date TBD)"

    "title": "Writing a Summary",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Writing a summary may seem to some like an easy task, while others might find it daunting. I think it’s both. Understanding what should go in a summary it’s crucial. This will not only help you write more useful summaries, but it will also help you become a more intentional reader.\nA summary should help you or someone else understand the main points of the piece as well as some of its context. It should answer the following questions:\n\nWhy is the text relevant? Why did the author(s) write it?\nWhat is the main conclusion of the text?\nHow do the author(s) reach their conclusions?\n(Optional, but useful) How does this work fit in with other texts or your observations?\n\nI would argue that a good summary for a journal article can be short (~5 sentences) or a bit longer (three-quarters of a page), depending on the level of detail that is required. For this class, anything in between these two lengths will suffice. I care much more about the content of the summary than its length.\n\nExample 1 - Abstracted structure of a summary\n\nThis is a little example of what a summary can look like (purpose/argument). Many students struggle to write summaries, and they end up outlining a text instead of summarizing the main points (context/relevance). To solve this, I am creating a page that includes questions a summary should answer, one abstract example of a summary, and two summaries of journal artices to help students write their summaries (method). Students read and referenced this page throughout the course (fingers crossed!) to write fantastic summaries of political science research (results). This shows that students only need a little guidance to achieve good results (implications).\n\n\n\nExample 2 - Summary of journal article\nIn the example below, I summarized this article:\n\nFrancis, R. W. (2006). Using Concept Maps as Assessment Tools: Defining Understanding. College Quarterly, 9(3), n3.1\n\nYou should be able to find the various parts highlighted above.\n\nThis article seeks to establish how concept maps can be useful for assessing understanding. Because concept maps structure knowledge, they can reveal how much students know and how they connect the ideas and concepts they have learned. To assess how many concepts and links between these concepts show understanding and breadth, the study uses upper-level education students and asks them to create concept maps for “effective teaching.” The resulting concept maps are divided into four levels and the conclusion is that concept maps that show breadth and depth of understanding have as many entries as the number of links to the main idea multiplied by ten. Although this research points in the opposite direction and its results do not seem generalizable (a good concept map may be denser or sparser depending on the discipline), it may be a good assessment tool and a way to show whether students who perform better have more structured, full concept maps.\n\n\n\nExample 3 - Longer summary of journal article\nThis example summarizes the following article:\n\nWald, Kenneth D., Dennis E. Owen, and Samuel S. Hill. 1988. “Churches as Political Communities.” American Political Science Review 82(2): 531–48.2\n\nAfter reading the summary, see if you can abstract the structure from the text.\n\nSummary\nWald, Owen, and Hill examine how an individual’s religious context affects their political attitudes. More specifically, the authors focus on how the religious beliefs of a congregation as a whole influence individual church members’ levels of moral conservatism and conservative ideology. Given the leadership structure and the repeated interactions between members of a church community, congregations represent a powerful social context for the dissemination of information and the enforcement of norms. As a competing explanation, the authors explore the influence of individual-level theology alongside congregational-level beliefs to ascertain whether an individual’s political attitudes are best explained by their own religious beliefs or those of their congregation.\nTo test their theory of congregational influence, the authors contacted churches in Gainesville, Florida, and obtained 657 completed surveys from 21 different congregations. The authors constructed a moral conservatism index by aggregating individual attitudes on issues such as abortion, homosexuality, birth control, drugs, and interracial marriage. Political ideology was measured through a standard self-placement measure on a 5-point scale, ranging from strongly liberal to strongly conservative. As their explanatory variable, theological conservatism taps into views about the Bible and evangelism as well as a respondent’s “born-again” experience. To obtain measures of moral, political, and theological conservatism at the congregation level, the authors calculate the average of the individual responses from each congregation.\nIn a series of multivariate regression analyses, the authors find that the more conservative the religious beliefs of a congregation the higher their levels of moral conservatism will be for both the congregation and the individuals. Although to a lesser extent, the same pattern holds when using political conservatism, measured through self-reported ideology, as the dependent variable. Additionally, while individual religious beliefs are also correlated with political attitudes, the impact of personal theology is not as large as that of the congregation’s theology. These results hold after accounting for individual-level characteristics such as partisanship, education, race, and age, and the possibility of individuals self-selecting into like-minded congregations. The findings underscore the importance of group-level influences on individual political attitudes.\n\n\nStructure\n\nThe first paragraph provides the main argument and tell us where the piece is situated in the literature.\nThe second paragraph tells us the methodology the authors use to evaluate their argument.\nThe third paragraph tells us the most important findings and what they mean.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n\n\nThis citation follows the APA citation style.↩︎\nThis citation follows the APSA citation style.↩︎"

We will begin by discussing Latino/x identity, identifying and describing the demographics of this population, and analyzing the extent to which Latinos have politicized identities. We will then analyze historical and demographic trends, including immigration patterns and policies as well as Chicano social and labor movements. After that, we will discuss Latino political behavior, where we will cover Latino public opinion, partisan affiliations, voting patterns, and representation. We will finish the course by discussing the role of Latinos in the last two elections, reflecting on both the narratives of the Latino vote in academia and the media."

The lectures will incorporate the readings assigned for that day/week. I expected you will have completed all readings prior to class and will come prepared with comments and questions. Unless noted otherwise, all readings will be made available on Canvas.\n\n\nAssignments and grades\nFinal course grades will be assigned as follows:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGrade\nRange\nGrade\nRange\n\n\n\n\nA\n93–100%\nC\n73–76%\n\n\nA−\n90–92%\nC−\n70–72%\n\n\nB+\n87–89%\nD+\n67–69%\n\n\nB\n83–86%\nD\n63–66%\n\n\nB−\n80–82%\nD−\n60–62%\n\n\nC+\n77–79%\nF\n< 60%\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFinal grades will be calculated based on the following components:\nParticipation (20%): All students are expected to be active participants in class discussions. Our learning experience will be enhanced if you come prepared and ready to share your comments, insights, and/or questions from the material covered in the lectures and readings with the rest of the class.\n\n\nAttendance policy:\n\nAttendance is part of your participation grade, and while there is no separate grade for attendance it is a prerequisite for in-class participation. That said, to accommodate unforeseeable circumstances, you have two unexcused absences that will not affect your participation grade. Please let the instructor know about any excused absences you anticipate during the semester. Note that students who are absent, whether excused or not, are still expected to submit the weekly summary corresponding to that week.\n\nWeekly summaries (15%): Each week for 9 weeks, you will summarize one of the readings (bolded below). That means you can skip some weeks. It is up to you which weeks you decide to skip. The summary must be no longer than three-quarters of a page (single-spaced, 12-point font). These summaries must be submitted via Canvas by 10:50 am on Thursdays. No credit will be given for submissions after class has started.\nTwo Papers (30%; 15% each): You will be writing two short papers (4-6 pages each) throughout the course. These assignments will require you to think about how what we learn in class relates to what you can observe in your political environment (what some call “the real world”). The assignment will also provide you with an opportunity to practice writing in different two genres for two different audiences. You can find a short description of each paper below (detailed instructions will be provided on Canvas):\n\n\nLiterature Review (4-6 pages):\n\nstudents will select a topic of interest and discuss how the existing literature address that topic. Students will identify what kinds of data political scientists have analyzed and will identify a gap in the literature that they would be interested in addressing in their final paper. The audience for this paper is an academic audience interested in Latino politics.\n\nCampaign memo (4-6 pages):\n\nstudents will write a campaign memo for a Senate campaign on the political attitudes and behaviors of Latinos/as. Students must provide sufficient background, provide clear takeaways, and propose strategies for a political campaign to appeal to Latino voters. The audience for this paper is a political campaign staff.\n\n\nPapers must be submitted via Canvas. Late submissions will be penalized: half a point (out of 10) if turned in late but on the same day and one point for each 24-hour period after the due date.\n\nOral Presentation (15%): Students will give an oral presentation based on their idea for the final paper. This will take the form of a conference presentation. Further instructions will be provided on Canvas and the instructor will model how to do such a presentation.\nFinal Paper (20%): In the final paper for this class, students will propose a research design to answer a question of interest. The question may be the same as the one that motivated the literature review from earlier in the course, but it may also be a different one. This paper must include an introduction, a literature review that situates the present question in the broader field, an answer to the question (the argument/theory), and a proposed design to answer the question. Students should meet with the instructor to discuss the paper and think about how one might design a study to answer the question of interest."
